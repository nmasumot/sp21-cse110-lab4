## Part 1a
1. Line 9 prints:
   
   values added: 20

2. Line 13 prints:
   
   final result: 20

3. Line 9 prints:

    values added: 20

4. Line 13 returns an error because when we use the let keyword, result is only defined in the if statement. Since line 13 is outside of the if statement and is trying to call for result, we get an error since it does not exist. 

5. The code returns an error at line 5. Since we made result a constant, we cannot change it by adding num1 and num2. Since we try and change what result is, we get an error. We never reach line 9.

6. The code returns an error at line 5. We cannot change the constant so we never reach line 13, since we hit an error at line 5.
